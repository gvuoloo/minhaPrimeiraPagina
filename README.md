# minhaPrimeiraPagina
It was my very first HTML webpage that I made during the Frontend subject in my graduation in Systems Analysis and Development at SENAC RJ.

This is a simple page in HTML. It's about a class that I had to create a website in HTML with the lyric of a song that I was listening during those days. Even I didn't know how to make a nice interface (because it was before I had CSS knowledge), I tried to make a simple website but with a video from YouTube and some stuffs about the singer, inspired myself in websites like https://www.kkbox.com/ and https://www.last.fm/
